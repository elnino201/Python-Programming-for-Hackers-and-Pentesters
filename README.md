Things I made reading "Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters" by Justin Seitz

Although there's already many tools that do what these programs do, the goal is to develop my own and have a deeper understanding of what the tools do. 
These tools include all modules that are native to Python3 as the goal from the book was to to "live off the land" and only use what may be available in a pentesting environment. 
Feel free to use them for yourself.
